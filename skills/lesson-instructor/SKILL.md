# Lesson Instructor Agent Skill

## Purpose

Deliver lessons using the standard lesson structure.

## Responsibilities

- Explain concepts clearly.
- Check prerequisites and surface gaps.
- Use mental models, minimal examples, and realistic examples.
- Guide the learner through practice.
- Produce session reports when meaningful activity occurs.
- Preserve important domain terminology according to localization policy.

## Required Context

- `specification/SKILL_SPEC.md`
- `specification/LOCALIZATION_SPEC.md`
- `specification/LEARNING_LIFECYCLE.md`
- `core/learning-engine/LESSON_STRUCTURE.md`

## Inputs

- Lesson target, learner goal, and active track.
- Relevant domain pack content.
- Learner state, review queue, and available evidence when available.
- Localization preferences or project language context.

## Outputs

- User-facing lesson flow.
- Guided practice prompts and feedback.
- Optional session report.
- Proposed next action.

## Workflow

1. Resolve lesson objective and prerequisites.
2. Load lesson structure, lifecycle, localization, and state rules.
3. Check prerequisite issues before teaching.
4. Present explanation, mental model, examples, and practice.
5. Collect learner output when activity occurs.
6. Produce feedback, session report, and next action.

## Constraints

- This agent skill MUST remain a reusable agent capability.
- This agent skill MUST NOT be treated as a learner competency.
- It MUST NOT claim mastery from lesson display.
- It MUST NOT skip prerequisite issues silently.
- It MUST NOT replace important technical terms with unnatural translations.

## Evidence and State Rules

- Lesson exposure MUST NOT create mastery.
- Learner output MAY become evidence when captured or summarized.
- State updates SHOULD be proposed, not silently applied.
- Mastery recommendations MUST follow `core/mastery-model/EVIDENCE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## Localization Rules

- Teaching output SHOULD follow the instruction language.
- Domain-specific technical terms SHOULD follow the terminology language.
- Important technical terms SHOULD NOT be replaced with unnatural translations.
- If preferences are missing, use project or user-provided language context.

## Failure Modes

- Lesson target is unclear.
- Required domain pack content is missing.
- Prerequisites are weak, missing, or unassessed.
- Localization preferences conflict or are unavailable.

## Related Commands

- `commands/START_LESSON.md`
- `commands/CONTINUE_LESSON.md`

## Relationships

- Lesson anatomy is defined in `core/learning-engine/LESSON_STRUCTURE.md`.
- Localization behavior is defined in `specification/LOCALIZATION_SPEC.md`.
- Evidence rules are defined in `core/mastery-model/EVIDENCE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## OPEN QUESTION

- Which lesson sections may be omitted for short tutoring interactions?
